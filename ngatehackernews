Amazon Launchpad for Startups
September 01, 2016

Amazon would like to sell your shitty kickstarter products.  Hackernews
cannot decide if they're concerned enough about this centralization of
power to post on medium about how dangerous it is; doing so would take away
from the time they need to write android apps and monitor their adsense
income and check their gmail accounts to make sure they're not missing a
hangout.  One-third of them complain that the images on the program website
are not huge enough.  Others are disgruntled because someone may compete
with them.

Canadian surgeons urge people to throw out bristle BBQ brushes
September 02, 2016

Hackernews is mortally terrified of small pieces of metal, because
Canadians cannot stop eating them.  One person suggests actually paying
attention to how you clean your grill, and is hailed as a hero.  Another is
disappointed to own the only grill spatula ever made that does not have a
bottle opener built in.  There is no discussion of technology.

Chrome is warning users about insecure pages
September 03, 2016

Google, furious that ISPs are able to compete with Google Analytics at all,
configures Chrome to bitch at people who use unencrypted http.  Self-signed
certificates are still regarded as worse than no encryption at all.  Tim
Berners-Lee, unsatisfied with having ruined the internet to the current
degree, wants to add STARTTLS to http.  Hackernews is deeply impressed by
this idea, as it gets them one step closer to being able to outsource
frontend to Bootstrap, backend to Heroku, security to Google, and
accounting to Stripe, leaving them free to decide which market sector's
laws are insufficiently ignored (i.e.  "ready for disruption").

People in Los Angeles Are Getting Rid Of Their Cars

The richest, most childless demographic on earth cannot figure out why

Tor’s Branding Pivot Is Going to Get Someone Killed

How to Write a Spelling Corrector

A Google updates some old python to new python.  Hackernews takes the

disproved by what passes for literature review from the original author.
Everyone is amazed to see met this blistering 21st-century webscale
performance goal of ten words per second.  The author defends the work by
casually mentioning not having tried very hard.  Nobody mentions -- even
once -- Lorinda Cherry, presumably because Lorinda Cherry did not work at

Python 3.6 dict becomes compact and keywords become ordered
September 10, 2016

Python decides its programmers can never be trusted to do something
correctly, so it decides to change the definition of 'correct'.  The
changes are left out of the actual language specification, so that when the
implementation changes again in a few years everyone will get fucked.
Hackernews decides that doing things carefully is the same as doing nothing
at all.  dict and OrderedDict will both remain and accidentally do the same
thing as each other.  One Hackernews recommends revoking trust in
python.org's SSL certificate and routing the web traffic through Google's
cache instead.

Why building a startup is probably your most sensible career path

Hackernews, while generally agreeing with the idea that not every single
human being on earth requires a PhD, gets breathlessly outraged at the idea
that it might be possible for anyone who is not a Hackernews to start a
business.  They caution that it is difficult to be successful without the
"right contacts and attitude" (e.g., being a Silicon Valley brogrammer with
a trust fund), but concede it's probably worth a shot anyway, since all

microservices are more successful when deployed by organizations that are

Wal-Mart pays its employees more than they used to, resulting in cleaner
stores, higher sales, and lower profits.  Hackernews reminisces about how
great and/or awful it was when they worked at Wal-Mart.  No technology is
discussed.

Numerai – A hedge fund built by a global community of anonymous data scientists
October 17, 2016

Some Bitcoin idiots try to program investments.  Hackernews decides they
don't trust it, but only one of them figures out why.  The rest while away
the afternoon trading poorly-conceived economic theories and untested
investment advice.  One Hackernews provides insight into hedge fund
management, and asks whether anyone can tell if the Bitcoin idiots are
succeeding.  Nobody knows.

Why Your Next iPhone Won't Be Ceramic
October 18, 2016

A two-megabyte webpage informs us that Apple will not make a ceramic iPhone
because it makes aluminum iPhones.  Hackernews is suddenly full of
materials scientists and machine-tool experts.  The author shows up to
respond to all criticism by claiming to have known that already, but having
cut relevant sections out of the article to meet an arbitrary length limit
nobody cares about.  Hackernews toys with the idea that programmers are not
really engineers, but decides that they are after all because they read
blog posts about process.

The Linux Foundation Unites the JavaScript Community for Open Web Development

Hackernews agrees with the latter but disputes the list of javascript shit

depending on whether the judge stands to make any money from its adoption.
Someone notices there are no meaningful web companies listed among the

Netflix Chaos Monkey Upgraded
October 20, 2016

Netflix has written software to fuck over computers at random.  There is a
new version that just turns them off instead.  A Netflix employee appears
and explains the change was made because a program called 'Chaos Monkey'
was found to be insufficiently sophisticated or precise.  Hackernews is
attracted to this software, because they sense in it the seed of an
artificial intelligence to which they can relate on a personal level.

The Neural Network Zoo

An internet has drawn pictures of the various state machines that computer
scientists use to obfuscate statistics.  One Hackernews bemoans the fact
that machine learning is bullshit, but to avoid being culled as a
nonbeliever, couches it in terms of 'theoretical underpinnings.'  Another
Hackernews jokes that everything must be fine because something sometimes
seems to work, and most of the rest of the herd takes this at face value.
The rest of the thread is comprised of some Hackernews asking for help
understanding the core concepts involved, and the others assuring them that
nobody understands anything.  A bibliography is constructed demonstrating
the latter.

Why does software development take so long?
October 27, 2016

An internet releases a new version of some video editing software, which is
written in C++.  He posts a blog full of excuses regarding the lengthy
delay between releases of this video editing software, which is written in
C++.  Hackernews responds by saying that programming is engineering, but
it's nothing like other kinds of engineering;  it is its own very special
kind of engineering.  Writing a piece of software is compared to building a
skyscraper, constructing the Panama canal, designing a real bridge that
alive people use, designing a house, a vacuum cleaner, the actual
biological process of evolution, and painting a picture.  Hackernews seems
to think that civil engineers still design infrastructure with drafting
tables and pencils.  In accordance with federal law, someone talks about
rust.  The commenter pretends to mean iron oxide, but we can tell the
meaning is the programming language because the quote is "it doesn't matter
if there is some rust," which is the best possible description of the
entire Rust project.

it to insert some kind of soapboxy lecture about how we all owe it to the
author to take action in supporting some political views.  The code is
buggy.  Hackernews agrees with the author and also doesn't.

Microsoft is bringing Windows 10, with desktop app support, to ARM chipsets

sense of focus, produces a product nobody wants, and continues to exist
only because senior leadership doesn't even have an exit plan.  Hackernews

Intel’s first Optane SSD: 375GB that you can also use as RAM
March 20, 2017

Intel releases new expensive drives that are almost, but not really, fast
enough to be used as random-access memory.  The drives require an OS under
your OS to live up to marketing hype.  Hackernews debates whether the hype
is worth believing by exchanging third-party blog posts on the topic, all
of which were written before the product was announced and none of which
are based on any actual testing.  The "this is HUGE" post is made and
Hackernews trades misconceptions about why.  The rest of the comments
speculate on which shitty database technology will get faster when the
commenter's company shits money at Intel instead of fixing their code.

The Document Which Used to Be Called the MIT Lockpicking Guide (1992)

An internet claims they're "linking to" a lockpicking guide "for
educational purposes", then proceeds to host the document in its entirety.
Hackernews decides that locks aren't enough, and in fact walls aren't
enough.  Some Hackernews bikeshed OCR, document typesetting, and file
formats.  One Hackernews keeps getting shit stolen at the gym.  Hackernews
advises to use a better lock, don't use a better lock, carry a safe around,
leave all the shit at home, hire a security guard, or leave all the shit in

Getting Started with Headless Chrome

Google enables webshits to remove the 'browsing' part of their web browser.
Hackernews trades python programs about it.  One Hackernews is inspired to
run a browser several times with a filesystem and a network interface for
each copy, but dismisses virtual machines as "too heavy."  Everyone else
just wants to take screenshots without the 'screen' part.

Root – Programmable bank account for software developers
May 03, 2017

A foreign bank wants you to rub javascript on your money.  Their example
code involves transaction approval in a Slack message.  Hackernews, the
place where crypto code is too hard for mortals to write and the Rust
Evangelism Strike Force has indoctrinated a deep-seated fear of pointers,
thinks applying javascript directly to money is a fantastic idea.  Most of
the comments are people misinforming each other about banking law,
international fiduciary policy, and needlessly in-depth descriptions of the
retarded things Hackernews does to feel in control of their money.

Uber faces criminal probe over software used to evade authorities

A jitney cab outfit is in dutch with the fuzz.  Hackernews divides into two
groups:  people who are slightly upset at how brazenly Uber is willing to
shit on the law, and people who are firmly convinced that no laws are valid
if such laws prevent money from changing hands.  Most of the people on the
latter side are the same idiots who insist that Uber is "ride-sharing" and
not just a shitty taxi company.  Countless thousands of words are wasted
arguing about whether Uber is demonstrating "civil disobedience" or
"criminal conspiracy."

the comments are Hackernews insisting that it is not only impossible to
compete with Google in any way but also insane to try.  Some Googles show
up to assure everyone that this is for the greater good, and if you'd all
just stop talking and get in line the whole process will be nearly
painless.  A few Hackernews suggest that AMP's feature set can be
replicated with a "stop shoving every fucking possible line of javascript
into every single pageload" approach, but they are quickly chloroformed and

Your own company? You can do it (2011)

An internet relates an utterly pedestrian life story.  Hackernews stumbles

self-help book happened to make them feel smartest.  The rest of the

Uber Founder Travis Kalanick Resigns as C.E.O.
June 20, 2017

An asshole quits a job.  Hackernews absolutely explodes, because Uber's
business model ("fuck you and your laws") aligns perfectly with Hackernews'
most firmly-held convictions.  Many thousands of words are deployed to
explain carefully to each other that a jitney-cab with a smartphone app is
the most monumental societal development in the history of humanity, and
that it is absolutely criminal that an executive should be forced out of a
cushy job for trivial transgressions like "building an entire corporation
on the idea that women are not people" and "abusing your own employees."
Most Hackernews hold the opinion that this one person leaving the company
will destroy the company, never pausing to wonder how great the place must
be if one asshole going home is all it takes to burn everything down.

Hackernews concludes that Uber was unfairly treated by everyone involved

binary is 1.1mb stripped, the utility only reliably builds on Linux and
MacOS, and the term "fast" is defined as "on par with ls".  Hackernews
spends some time sternly admonishing people who are not sufficiently
impressed.  Half of the comments are people arguing about whether computers
should emit colors.  The other half of the comments are people arguing
about whether humans can read numbers.  The Rust Evangelism Strike Force
recommends several resources for people who would like to poorly
reimplement other unix tools.

Martin Shkreli is found guilty of securities fraud

An expired Twitter meme is convicted of a crime.  Hackernews used to hate

each other on this change of heart, mistaking it for critical thinking.
Much fun is had reinventing securities laws, medical billing practices,
psychological diagnoses, and the criminal justice system.  None of the

uBlock Origin Maintainer on Chrome vs. Firefox WebExtensions

explains that Firefox's superiority comes from its diverse collection of
databases and indices, which work together to prevent the user from ever
having to know or remember anything at all.  Several Hackernews debate
whether Chrome's ability to assist webshit in lying to the user is a good
feature or a required feature.  The rest of the comments are pissing

for pretending browser vendors are not in an abusive relationship with

YouTube AI deletes war crimes evidence as 'extremist material'
August 12, 2017

Google continues their long-held tradition of randomly taking shit off the
internet.  The latest twist is that they have advanced Tensorflow
technology sufficiently that they can now blame computers for
mismanagement.  Hackernews tries to figure out why Google, when enforcing
arbitrary and capricious termination of services, insists on being a dick
about it in the process.  Instead of coming to the obvious conclusion ("the
user is not only beneath contempt, the user is beneath any consideration at
all"), Hackernews writes fanfiction about the kind of egalitarian
censorship-proof internet they'd like to have, and the imaginary incentives
they would provide to bring it about.  Nothing productive is said.

Apple Scales Back Its Ambitions for a Self-Driving Car

"scaling back" is about focusing on a good project, instead of wildly

never do that.  Half the threads are web programmers carefully creating a
priori justifications for each decision Apple is rumored to have made, just
in case someone somewhere gets an idea that Apple is fallible.  The other
half are web programmers toying with maybe reinventing the wheel, because
Apple considered it, in hopes of finding a place in that open-plan Aerobie

Buffett wins $1M decade-old bet that the S&P500 would outperform hedgefunds

U.S. Navy to use Xbox 360 controllers to operate periscopes aboard submarines

Do you need a VPN?
October 30, 2017

Mozilla asks a question, then completely fails to even almost answer it.
This is part of their new push to generate blog articles in the same way
they generate code.  Hackernews spends some time marveling that the nation
with the second-highest GDP on earth can somehow figure out how to control
their own telecommunications infrastructure.  Meanwhile, the answer
Hackernews seems to be taking for granted is "yes, you do need a VPN,"
because they spend most of their time trading advice on which privacy
services can best protect the tracking data their browsers are sending back
to Google.

Reaching $10k monthly revenue with WakaTime, my SaaS side project

An internet posts an interview with some other internet, who made a program
or something, and spends most of the interview telling people to stop
reading.  Hackernews administrators arrive to explain that there's some
kind of pseudo-legal drama occurring with the interviewee, who immediately
shows up to shit talk the other parties.  One Hackernews expresses concern
at the amount of data the program sends back to some rando's servers, and
is shouted down because clearly the only way to measure anything is by
uploading it to the internet.  The rest of the comments are idiots arguing

Letting users skip our paywall if they wrote an apology
November 01, 2017

Unsatisfied merely with charging money for webshit, an asshole also demands
contrition.  The webshit in question puts text onto gif files.  Hackernews

The consensus is that it's just too hard for people to give them money.

An Internet bemoans the state of the web.  Three of the four contact

further complaints to add to the list.  Some of them think the solution is
podcasts, because the obvious alternative to modal advertisement popups is
listening to some Internet stutter into a Blue Yeti for three hours.
Another claims to have learned programming primarily via web videos.  I had

How Firefox Got Fast Again
November 13, 2017

Mozilla excretes some public relations drivel about their latest release,
complete with the same condescending cartoons that appeared in the last
four.  Given a buzzword codename, the release's reported success involves
deleting any code that is insufficiently identical to their main
competitor.  Hackernews is elated about how much more Chrome-like Firefox
has become, but grievously disappointed in the few remaining pieces that
persist in not being Google products.  Consensus:  Hackernews really wants
to use Firefox because it is not Chrome, but cannot abide using it, because
it is not Chrome.

complain to the FCC, which is a time-tested and reliable approach to
solving internet problems.  A Comcast shows up to paste boilerplate
responses, but Hackernews gets distracted armchair-lawyering the details of
Comcast's Bad Customer Service guidelines (RFC 6108).

F.C.C. Repeals Net Neutrality Rules

Firefox is on a slippery slope

reckless disregard for sanity is a recent development, instead of something
inherited from Netscape.  Some Mozillas arrive to defend their idiocy.
Confusion dominates the comment threads as many Hackernews struggle with
the idea of a computer being anything other than a device that displays
advertisements from tech companies.  The Mozillas are unable or unwilling
to understand why Pocket, Cliqz, and now this crap would anger anyone.
Finally, one Hackernews realizes that web browsers are sufficiently complex
that nothing short of a major corporation can sustain their development.

everyone that this is for the best.

Curry spice turmeric boosts memory by nearly 30%, eases depression, study finds
January 24, 2018

Some academics feed pills to a negligible number of old people.  Hackernews
erupts into trench warfare between those who learned about science from
Wikipedia and those who learned about science from working in the web
advertising industry.  Every soldier in the battlefield dutifully loads and
fires reference materials into the enemy, none of which are relevant to the
article at hand.  Inevitably, the fracas dissolves into extremely gullible
Hackernews peddling nutritional supplements and superstitions about health
care.

How to Run Your Own Mail Server (2017)
January 26, 2018

An Internet posts a short story about running a mail server based on four
software packages, three of which are extraneous.  Hackernews, as with all
articles about doing anything for yourself, cries like tiny babies about
how hard it is to send and receive email.  The few Hackernews who express
puzzlement at the wave of whining are derided by Hackernews who haven't
used anything but GMail since 2006.  A few spammers ask real human beings
for tips on evading spam filters.

Microsoft disables Spectre mitigations as Intel’s patches cause instability

different product, but not that one either.  At some point there is a
hundred-comment-long thread about Ubuntu, which causes a spate of posts

A Career Cold Start Algorithm
March 08, 2018

A webshit advocates learning about things by asking people who know the
answers.  Hackernews misconstrues the title to be about getting a job,
which explodes into lengthy and bitter arguments about whether you'll get a
shitty job, be too shitty for the great jobs that Hackernews has to offer,
or get a shitty job working for shitty people doing shitty things.  Once
Hackernews is finished studiously ignoring the fact that they're all in the
third category, they try to decide whether the webshit's advice is only for
people who matter, or if fungible javascript-assembly-line workers are
allowed to hear it too.

FCC Accuses Stealthy Startup of Launching Rogue Satellites
March 09, 2018

The United States Government disapproves of a startup, "Uber for Kessler
Effects," which is funded in part by the United States Government.
Hackernews spends six years arguing whether or not the United States
Government should have a say in whether a company registered in the United
States, located in the United States, and funded by the United States
Government is allowed to skulk off and pay some discount space agency for a
ride.

Round Peg in a Square Hole [video]
March 10, 2018

A glowing man is concerned about an oversized communion wafer.  At least,
that's what it looks like, based on the thumbnail of this Youtube video,

Vim Clutch – A hardware pedal for improved text editing (2012)
March 11, 2018

An idiot builds a really bad keyboard.  Hackernews reminisces about other
bad keyboards they've seen and fantasizes about bad keyboards still to
come.  When that winds down, the topic switches to the scads of dumb
garbage they've all squirreled away in their text editor configurations.
At least one Hackernews in this discussion has more commits to a "dotfiles"
repository than all other programming work combined.

Theranos, CEO Holmes, and Former President Balwani Charged with Fraud
March 14, 2018

The Securities and Exchange Commission lowers the boom on some charlatans.
Hackernews nitpicks the announcement, trying to ascertain exactly how much
"lying to investors" needs to take place before they're next against the
wall -- is it an absolute amount?  How many thousands of words of bullshit
will bring the feds?  Is it a relative amount?  Is your business being
entirely bullshit-based grounds for an exemption?  If other, richer
bullshit artists get away with it, might it be worth trying anyway?
Hackernews feverishly scrabbles at the walls of their Habitrail,
desperately seeking a return to a world where lying to everyone you meet
while blowing through hundreds of millions of dollars of other people's
money is praised as entrepreneurship, rather than prosecuted in court.

China to bar people with bad 'social credit' from planes, trains

to reassure everyone that everything is fine, and anyone who doesn't like

Self-driving Uber car kills Arizona woman crossing street
March 19, 2018

Uber A/B tests vehicular manslaughter.  Hackernews argues about the exact
speed they think would have allowed the victim to live with horrific
injuries instead of actually dying, then decide they would have killed that
stranger too and the press is just overreacting because the car was being
driven by a computer.  Soon enough, says Hackernews, a robotic jitney cab
will be able to slaughter people at random and nobody will notice or demand
accountability.  Until that day comes, Hackernews decides to argue about
exactly how much safer we'd all be if nobody ever did anything without a
computer's permission ever again.

Blocklist Facebook domains (2016)
March 20, 2018

An internet posts a tiny subset of Facebook's domain names.  Hackernews
produces an avalanche of software designed to prevent your computer from
communicating with Facebook, and then argues about the technical minutiae
involved with the task.  Once that's done, they take up the question of
whether working for an ad agency built around monetizing the secrets of a
third of the world's population constitutes any possible ethical hazards.
The usual chorus strikes up to sing about how Hackernews would stop using
Facebook if they could, but it's just not possible for human life to
proceed without it.

Facebook, in response to the news that someone misused Facebook users'

Hackernews isn't really convinced anyone did anything wrong to start with,
and is sufficiently bored by the topic that they decide to rant about Obama
instead.  Another set of Hackernews huddle up to try inventing a system
that would allow webshits to swim around in people's personal information
in a manner less likely to attract media attention.   The usual chorus

How to Fall Asleep in Two Minutes or Less

An Internet reports on secret military training for going to sleep:  stop

sleeping, and is immediately instructed to demand a device that records
every single breath, preventing the horrible dystopia in which someone does
something without telling a computer about it.  I didn't think anything
could be less interesting to read than the Dropbox circlejerk, but nearly
two hundred comments comprised of nerds recounting all the ways they fail

which browsers could protect user data, but discards them all because it
breaks the websites they all work on for a living.  A few Hackernews deride
the effort as pointless because it is not flawless.  The rest of the

Hackernews' relentless optimism about this trivial government filing report

jam-packed with products that are not new, perform extremely poorly, and

alive who can develop software that uses any other protocol.  A handful of

package management from first principles, and linux tech support.  That's
one comment thread.  Comment thread two is pearl-clutching about whether
Adobe and Autodesk will bother to support Apple computers that don't run
Intel processors, which launches a catfight about CPU benchmarks.  The
remaining comment threads are all remixes of the first two, except for the
breathtaking quote "There are no good or bad ideas".

cautioned that while paying attention exclusively to yourself comes
naturally, shutting the fuck up for a while was a harrowing experience, not

jest, but takes it too far with lines like "very painful meditation" and
claiming to have spent damn near two months on this shit.  Nobody could be

Teenager facing prison for downloading unsecured files from government website
April 16, 2018

Some Canadian bureaucrats accidentally dumped everyone's purse on the
table, and are lashing out at a teenage data hoarder.  Hackernews debates
whether the government fucked up because Canadians elected too many old
people or if it's because Canadians elected too many stupid people.
Several dozen shitty analogies are invented as the rest of Hackernews
attempts to convince each other that manually typing in URLs should be
punishable by death, because that's simpler to implement than proper access
controls.

Apple open-sources FoundationDB

Apple signs up for free labor.  Hackernews is over the moon, since about
70% of them seem to have worked on this particular software for a living.
Several are puzzled and disappointed that Apple only released the core
component and not any of the parts that make it useful.  Others keep
showing up to brag about running "petabyte-scale clusters" on other
people's computers ("all kinds of aws instances").  Dozens of comments
enumerate all the amazing things you can do with this software, all of
which involves recreating existing software.  The project in question is
distributed fault-tolerant key-value store #8,605, which uses SQLite to
actually store the data.

IBM is not doing "cognitive computing" with Watson (2016)

An old person is mad that IBM's ad copy looks like the name of a book the
old person wrote when Steve Wozniak still worked for Apple.  In an industry
that brands the concept of "inept statistics" as "machine learning" and
"artificial intelligence," the author must be in a constant state of rage.
While Hackernews agrees that IBM's terminology is criminally inaccurate,
all the other machine learning tools are actually cool and good because
some of them seem to work once in a while.  Hackernews discusses the
impossibility of understanding anyone who says anything -- whether using a
computer or Hackernews' own brain -- and decides the only path forward is
to crush human expression into a format more easily parsable by whatever

Amazon threatens to suspend Signal's AWS account over censorship circumvention

Some nerds are mad that massive corporations won't let them trickfuck
internet connections from fascist regimes.  The article is composed of
pedantic whining about their technical adherence to the protocol
specification, which the authors apparently think will prevent third-world
despots from shitcanning the entire internet.  Hackernews is of two minds
on the topic:  on one hand, trickfuckery is the primary capital-raising
construct Hackernews employs, while on the other hand, these assholes
aren't even serving ads or collecting users' personal data.  This dichotomy
is unresolved, while a much smaller and more interesting debate unfolds.
One side believes that the American military should destroy any government
inimical to Amazon's profit margins, while the other holds the opinion that
maybe mass slaughter is perhaps an overreaction to an internet traffic
disagreement.  Your editor looks forward to seeing the NO BLOOD FOR URL

JavaScript is Good, Actually

A webshit incorrectly decides that javascript is not a shitshow, because
all of the bad design choices have excuses and workarounds.  You just don't
know javascript the way webshits do; it loves them and it only hits them
when it's been drinking, which is not its fault.  Hackernews is seized in a
paroxysm of indecision; they can sort-of map javascript shit to the things
they learned in Khan Academy computer science videos, but not quite... so
is this a failing in javascript, to be a pile of bad implementations of
questionable goals?  Or is this a failing in computer science, to have
posited concepts that javascript can't quite fully deploy?  This conundrum
proves to be insurmountable, so Hackernews settles in to enumerate every
single programming language they've ever heard of, compare them all to
javascript, and agree that as bad as it is, it's not C, which is hard and
the people who use it are mean.  Perl is not mentioned at all in the entire

May 24, 2018

A consumer is startled to learn that the domesticated wiretaps voluntarily
installed in homes are not only surveilling the users, but also dropping
dimes on them effectively at random.  Amazon takes privacy very seriously
-- unless you prefer some other emotion, in which case they'll take your
privacy however they can get it.  Hackernews is completely unsurprised by
this turn of events, given that they either live with, went to a coding
boot camp with, or in fact are the party responsible for writing whatever
garbage software is running on these piles of shit.

GDPR for lazy people: Block all European users with Cloudflare Workers
May 25, 2018

Some webshits narrate the process of paying other webshits to keep the euro
trash off of your cyber lawn.  Hackernews can't decide if the new European
privacy law is a noble attempt to defend the masses or a nuclear weapon
pointed directly at their shitty video chat startups.  Hackernews is livid
that someone passed a law they can't just pay someone else for the
privilege of ignoring, but are grateful for the opportunity to spend their
lunch breaks writing fanfiction about what their court cases will look like
when they try to Uber their way out of complying.

The Importance of Deep Work and the 30-Hour Method for Learning a New Skill

Python’s For - Else
May 27, 2018

An Internet posts some poorly-formatted Python tutorials as an excuse to

language might have behavior specific to that language.  Fifty thousand
comments are posted whining that the keyword should be a different keyword,
with the only exceptions coming from Hackernews who actually use the
programming language.  The consensus is that any language feature which
Hackernews did not learn about in two hours of Coursera video lectures
should be expunged from the planet.

AI winter is well on its way

Rounding out the top twenty are several extremely popular sites, such as

much better DIY echo chamber construction kit than Facebook, caters more
directly to their pornography tastes than Tumblr, and allows them to create
a new account when they are no longer able to face their own comment

Microsoft Is Said to Have Agreed to Acquire GitHub
June 03, 2018

A near-monopoly closed-source software company, fed up with trying to seem
like a good corporate citizen by releasing source code of their worst
programs, is acquired by Microsoft.  Hackernews is either terrified or
cautiously optimistic, based exclusively on whether they've received money
from Microsoft in the past.  Some time is spent pretending they have
opinions about the business implications of the acquisition, but almost all
of the discussion has a different focus:  warnings from people who have
been fucked ruthlessly by large software companies, and complaints about
the unfairness of those opinions, mostly by people who haven't yet had
their turn in the barrel.  A brief sidebar is held on the topic of
decentralized internet services, wherein Hackernews explains that services
are mostly centralized because of the ineffable will of society, and not
because programmers aren't smart enough to build interoperable software.

Hello, GitHub

Microsoft, responding to the tremendous outpouring of user feedback about
their acquisition of Github, finds the perfect person to ensure that none
of it is acted upon or even heard:  a GNOME developer.  The announcement is
illustrated, for some reason, only with a 3-megapixel photograph nearly a

somewhere on the internet once.  The rest of the comments are copied and

Things I Regret About Node.js [video]

Some webshits presumably talk for half an hour about all the things they
fucked up;  I'm not watching this shit.  Hackernews explores reasons why
programmers can't seem to stop fucking everything up in nearly identical
ways on every project in wide use.  The consensus is that this must be some
fundamental atomic force at work, because it can't possibly just be a pack
of shitheads with no self control failing exactly like the previous packs
of shitheads with no self control.  The Rust Evangelism Strike Force flirts
with the idea of a campaign here, but doesn't have the heart for it, since
they're in the process of making all the same mistakes, in the same order,

isn't really sure how to exist without function (i, s, o, g, r, a, m) so

YouTube’s Piracy Filter Blocks MIT Courses, Blender Videos, and More

Google thinks that's some nice content you've got there, and it would be a
shame if something were to happen to it.  Hackernews agrees, but doesn't
think strongarming the content creators is enough -- what's needed is
revocation of entire sections of European copyright law, for some reason.
Apparently the law as written would unfairly require YouTube to perform
automatic content scanning it already performs.  Hackernews acknowledges
that this has nothing to do with Google demanding that content owners opt
into Google's advertising program, but it's easier for them to envision
overthrowing every government on the entire European continent than it is
even to consider challenging Google's behavior out loud.

Youtube-dl: Command-line program to download videos
July 04, 2018

A video scraping tool gets a new release.  Hackernews is grumpy because the
tool, which downloads videos from Google but does not display ads, isn't
trivially available on their Google-powered advertising-supported phone
operating system.  Hackernews argues about the best options to pass to the
tool.  One Hackernews is furious that someone has the audacity to play
music from Youtube at parties, and fervently defends the professional
tradecraft of playing music at parties.

EU copyright law proposal rejected

Europe caves to Big Wiki.  Hackernews doesn't think this is over; they
suspect that people whose entire job is to pass this legislation may
somehow be motivated to continue trying to pass this legislation.  The
armchair lawyers arrive and form up battle lines to decide whether people
should have any say in what laws are passed by their rulers.

Vue.js: the good, the meh, and the ugly
July 05, 2018

A webshit shits webshit about webshit.  Hackernews has tons of opinions
about the webshit in question, since it was the de facto alternative to the
other webshit du jour when Facebook threatened to throw its toys out of the
crib.  An argument immediately breaks out about whether it is appropriate
for software developers to develop software, or if their real job is
bolting together random shit they found on the internet.  Instead of
phrasing the argument in these terms, Hackernews communicates in the only
way they really know how:  namedropping javascript libraries and hoping the
other party has heard of them and can infer a position statement from the
set of libraries selected.  "React and Flux at the state machine!"  "VueX,
when the DOM fell."  Only one Hackernews dares to ask the really important
question:  what syntax highlighting color scheme is used by the article
author.

MacOS Mojave removes subpixel anti-aliasing, making non-retina displays blurry

Apple makes a slight change to font rendering.  Millions die in the
resulting apocalypse.  Hackernews lashes together otherwise-worthless 1080p
monitors to form a rampart around their 300-dpi enclave, the last remaining
bastion of enlightened civilization, under constant assault from the
mindless quasi-chordates whose reprobate "culture" is so degenerate that
they don't even care if they edit text on a screen with less than 120Hz

computer screens that cover less than 120% of the Adobe RGB color gamut.

particularly pissed off about the time when someone called for emergency

bicker about whether fire engines should be standardized internationally,
or complaining that firefighters do not work enough, or they're not smart
enough to handle lumber, or are too dumb to select a ladder.

Worst Computer Bugs in History: Therac-25 (2017)
August 11, 2018

An internet describes a time that bad software directly led to the deaths
of actual human beings.  Several "takeaways" are provided, absolutely none
of which involve recommending anyone be held responsible in any way.
Hackernews is gratified that so few deaths were all that was needed to
distract people from all the other ways that software developers are
failing civilization on a regular basis.  Other Hackernews suspects the
kill count is so low because only someone completely unhinged would put
their safety directly in the hands of a computer programmer.  When
highlighting other, less severe failure stories turns out not to be fun,
Hackernews explores ways they might blame someone else for the deaths.

Thank you HN

A Hackernews thanks the rest of Hackernews for not advocating suicide.
Hackernews lists all the terrible shit they did and/or had happen to them
and, as usual, catalogs every single real or perceived solution to mental
health issues they've ever tried or read about.  The consensus is that
exercise helps.  No technology is discussed.  An asshole violates the Prime

Using FOIA Data and Unix to halve major source of parking tickets
August 13, 2018

An internet is trying to help.  With awk.  Hackernews squabbles over
whether or not it's even possible for most people to help, given the

Serverless Docker Beta

Some webshits celebrate minutiae.  Hackernews is excited about the
minutiae, except for the ones who actually do things with computers once in
a while.  A long discussion breaks out about the proper method to embed
auto-playing video containing nothing but text.  After a while Hackernews
gets bored with the actual limitations of the garbage software described in
the article and starts running thought experiments about what even worse
software might look like.  They don't reach consensus, but I'm pretty sure
they're accidentally describing Sun software.

NYU Makes Tuition Free for All Medical Students
August 16, 2018

A medical school makes it slightly easier to go to medical school.
Hackernews, armed with a keen insight into the fundamental workings of both
economics and human society, dives into a thoughtful examination of why
rich people who are good at standardized tests make the finest medical
professionals.  Anyone breathing a hint of a concept that perhaps someone
might choose not to go to medical school because it's expensive is labeled
a dangerous seditionist.  Many lectures follow about how rich kids actually
have it worse than poor kids, taxation is theft, and studying any subject
not directly related to javascript makes you a selfish burden on
civilization.

Redux vs. The React Context API
August 18, 2018

Some webshits write up a deep dive into the newest, fullest septic tank.
The "Full Stack" you hear so much about has reached so high, and the lower
layers ossified so quickly, that Hackernews is forced to bicker about which
abstraction is appropriate as a simplified model with which to build
business logic to control the next abstraction down the stack ... which may
change depending on which AbstractionHandlerFactory you're targeting with
your glorified web guestbook.  Pedantic arguments break out about which
abstractions represent which other, slightly-more-generalized abstractions.
If you or someone you love has any positive opinions about any technologies

facility to determine if there is a path available to healthier living.  I

Intel Publishes Microcode Patches, No Benchmarking or Comparison Allowed

An Internet who whines about software licenses for a living whines about
software licenses.  Hackernews takes this trivial, meaningless event and
spins it into a yarn about the impending death of an organization upon
whose products almost every single major human endeavor is based.  Hundreds
of paragraphs of alternate-history fiction are produced to describe a
reality in which there's any chance at all you can avoid giving Intel

Changing Our Approach to Anti-Tracking
August 30, 2018

Mozilla assures us that they want to keep all our weird-ass internet habits
a secret, so they are offering ways to protect our privacy, such as sending
a complete log of all domain lookups[0] to a third-party commercial
partner.  Fear not, however, as they will still by default send all of your
search queries[1] to a different third-party commercial partner, as well as
asking Google (a third-party commercial partner) for permission to load
every single thing you try to look at[2], ever.  Hackernews reminisces
about how bad advertising used to be on the internet, or at least how
differently bad it was.  Some Hackernews mourn Mozilla's failed cellphone
outing, while others notice that rather than just sending your entire
browsing history to Google, Mozilla has built Google's tracking software
directly into Firefox[3].

affair with transpilers to take part in the I Agree With Google pledge, and
decides the only answer is to invent a whole new programming language to
solve this problem (and also every other problem).  Yet another Google
shows up to defend the honor of some other trashpiler, and the rest of the
comments are various partisans arguing that whatever Rube Goldberg

other Hackernews don impact armor and prepare to kettle and mace the

nearly a thousand comments, often with the same people arguing the same
position in some kind of many-to-many bad-opinion storm.  The primary
defense of Google's pointless bikeshedding seems to be "Apple does it," and
the primary critique seems to be "I am easily confused."  Deep underground

Firefox about:config privacy settings

manner that maximizes engagement with Github but prevents the use of any
useful features thereof.  The document goes into some detail about a myriad

that even this relatively comprehensive list cannot keep up with the pace
of Firefox's misfeature development; Hackernews notices that
browser.urlbar.trimURLs, media.autoplay.enabled, and so on are missing, but
neither the original author nor Hackernews remembers to set beacon.enabled
to false, which is the reason beacons exist.  Hackernews is uncomfortable
with the idea of being allowed to configure software (that's what plugins

Google activated battery saving mode on multiple phones, then rolled it back

A Reddit is concerned because a device running Android, an operating system
built to send and receive software and data to and from Google, has
received some software from Google.  For some unfathomable reason, a Google

truth: any amount of user tracking, security problems, planned
obsolescence, regulatory capture of the education sector, Asian fascism
enablement, Internet protocol derailment, or warmongering is acceptable
compared to the specter of someone sneaking a U2 record into your life.

learn that brutal honesty is the instrument of society's salvation or else
it is the Fimbulwinter that precedes the end.  Swearing on mailing lists is
either a weapon carefully constructed to marginalize women or else it is
the last remaining shred of Finnish culture, under constant threat.  Being
a dickhead to people who are paid to put up with your shit is a privilege
of era-defining genius or a character deficiency normally reserved for
Shakespearian kings.  The most popular comments, however, narrate the
mental gymnastics Hackernews is willing to perform to excuse any non-
pecuniary transgression, so long as Hackernews can reassure us that they
agree with the audience... no matter what the audience thinks.  Nuance:
the shortest path to abdication Silicon Valley has ever invented.

EU to stop changing the clocks in 2019
September 17, 2018

Hackernews finds another news article about some shit they discussed last
week.  This time around, the focus is on politics; a thread about a
Californian referendum leads to hundreds of Hackernews failing to
communicate their respective misunderstandings of both law and timekeeping.
Following that, the OCONUS Hackernews gather around to tell each other that
fiddling with rules about clocks is what makes the rest of the world
superior to the backwards nation that inexplicably dominates Earth.  That
thread only makes it to a few dozen posts before it devolves into a priori
arguments about Brexit.  The rest of the comments are pining for changes in
US state laws, some of which happened over a decade ago.

Life in the Spanish city that banned cars
September 18, 2018

In typical Grauniad fashion, the headline is almost comically inaccurate:
the city in question barred cars from two neighborhoods and unsurprisingly
made traffic worse in the surrounding area.  Hackernews picks up the
"America is doing it wrong" drum from yesterday's party and plays a new
song with it.  The Society for the Advancement of Robot Cars attempts to
propagandize, but the lure of bragging about not owning a car is too strong
for anything to take root.  Later, the amateur urban planners reconstruct
whatever city they last saw, while the fake economists debate whether the
agency of discretionary travel is an actual benefit to civic freedom or
just a phantom designed to extract money from rubes.

Ticketmaster recruits pros for secret scalper program

capitalism which will allow them to get into concerts cheaper without
admitting that some markets require regulation... because everyone in

People Like You More Than You Know
September 20, 2018

Hackernews, possibly the demographic least in need of a confidence boost,
finds a fluff piece about some half-assed "research" they can use to
convince themselves everyone else thinks Hackernews are great.  A couple
hundred of them show up in the comments to recount every time anyone
complimented them, and to rue the dearth of habitual praise in their
workplaces.  Nobody brings up impostor syndrome, probably because it's not
a syndrome if you really are an impostor.  Near the end, a few Hackernews
copy their "I don't care what anyone thinks" manifestos from their
early-2000s MySpace pages.

Why I’m done with Chrome
September 23, 2018

A security professional who uses Wordpress explains that Chrome is just
another weapon in Google's war against its own users.  Google retaliates by
causing the author's phone to route all trips via Monroe Street.
Hackernews unhappily discusses the increasingly unavoidable impression that
a massive multinational surveillance apparatus might not care about them
personally.  The implications of this topic are quickly subsumed by
hundreds of idiots ranting about Google search results being some kind of
political action, with the only reasonable countermeasure apparently being
whining about it on web forums.

Anatomy of a Killing

the people who slaughtered children on video.  The next discussion thread

Facebook Is Giving Advertisers Access To Your Shadow Contact Information
September 26, 2018

Facebook continues the war against its own users.  Hackernews is outraged
that a business founded on collecting personal information and then using
it to sell ads is using personal information to sell ads.  According to
Hackernews, there's a magical invisible aura attached to some personal
information, which makes it unethical to use for advertising.  No
exhaustive list of such is provided.  Having decided the moral argument is
too tiring to pursue, Hackernews shifts gears and argues about whether all
the glaring moral failures could be ameliorated by adding more software.

A Reddit has a dipshit roommate.  Hackernews appears to have previously
been unaware that people do bad things with computers sometimes, and some
of the more worldly Hackernews post links to other bad things like ghost

implemented as a set of utilities to log user activity, send it to some
unknown third party, then download and execute unvetted code directly on
the victim's hardware, which also precisely describes the products that
Hackernews make for a living.  The confusion is only natural.

higher,     because unregulated software engineers are more frequently
involved,    USA #1,     concerted attack from ambitious underdogs,    you
won't if you know what's good for you,    this question is meaningless
because you can't generalize "people,"    it's the only city in Nordvärld,
yes, nothing,    more meaningless generalizations ("science"),    they
already are, with programming languages,    there isn't one, make them
cheaper,    definitely not "the same thing but pirated,"    try
understanding individuals instead of pigeonholing them with pop-psych
trash,    yes (let's make a webring!),    because software engineering
stopped advancing in the 1980s.    Sure, the questions are actually meant
to be starting points for deeper investigations, but that's extremely off-

The Periodic Table of Data Structures [pdf]

Some students procrastinate.  Hackernews argues about whether or not the
periodic table of elements even works, then over the fashionability of the
works cited in the procrastination paper.  One Hackernews remembers another
paper, and hopes everyone can help find it.

Hubble is back
October 27, 2018

NASA posts a meaningful outage post-mortem.  Hackernews takes heart that
even complicated orbital maneuvers can be oversimplified and trivialized
sufficiently for Hackernews to disdain.  Once the silly space telescope
people are sufficiently derided, Hackernews starts a betting pool regarding
the exact date that orbital research careers will be eclipsed by artificial
intelligence.  Smart money is sometime in fiscal year 2020.

IBM acquires Red Hat
October 28, 2018

At long last, Lotus Notes (motto: "the PulseAudio of groupware") and
PulseAudio (motto: "the Lotus Notes of audio bureaucracy") are under the
same roof.  Hackernews has, over the years, developed a vicious, seething
hatred of IBM, because it is sufficiently large as to not give a shit about
magical Renaissance supermen like Hackernews.  All of the times that
someone at IBM failed to care about a Hackernews are documented here.
Later, a list of Red Hat projects is created, all of which are expected to
burn and die once the adults show up and ask where the money is.

Facebook exodus: Nearly half of young users have deleted the app
October 29, 2018

An asshole writes a 368-word article, then the webshits show up and serve
14.6 megabytes of unrelated bullshit for no reason.  Hackernews doesn't
even notice, because they're deep in the 'depressive' phase of the
Hackernews Manic-Depressive Webshit Disorder, wherein commenters mourn the
loss of agency, privacy, and dignity involved with all of the engagement-
hacking they do at their day jobs.  Within a week someone at one of the
surveillance media companies will write a distributed eventually-consistent
database in Rust, and Hackernews will explode with mania, completely
forgetting the soul-crushing effect their work has on their fellow humans.
For now, they're content to complain about how standing aside and doing
nothing is no longer considered a commendable political act.

laws work, and does not let a lack of ability stop them from lecturing
endlessly on international law, political conspiracy theories, and the
ethical characteristics of nations.  One Hackernews claims that someone
died of blockchains, which is the closest thing to technology anyone posts.

Goodbye, EdgeHTML
December 06, 2018

Mozilla looks forward to coming in second in a two-browser race.  This
thread is designated as the Monthly Firefox Opinion Repository, with the
same eight complaints as all the other threads even tangentially related to
Mozilla:  My preferred extension was deprecated; I can't live without this
obscure feature; it's too slow; I don't like the development tools; it's
not made by Apple; it's not made by Google; it's funded by Google; my
computer is old.  Neither this comment thread nor the original article will
influence anyone's opinion, either on "Hacker" "News" or at Microsoft.

Facial recognition: It’s time for action
December 07, 2018

Microsoft announces a new lobbying campaign.  Hackernews is ecstatic that
technocrats are unilaterally declaring policy, as this system is much
cheaper and more effective than outmoded and obviously ridiculous
alternatives, such as democracy.  The rest of the comments are Hackernews
eagerly reading political tea leaves or angrily demanding that Microsoft be
given authority to conduct capital punishment against anyone who
inconveniences them.

Australia’s vague anti-encryption law sets a dangerous new precedent
December 08, 2018

A webshit mailhost denounces a bad law in another country, apparently under
the impression that anyone in Australia cares about the political opinions
of some Swiss nerds.  Hackernews doesn't really care about the mail
service; this post was selected as the Armchair Legal Theorists meeting
location for the month of December.  The Hackernews interpretations of this
set of laws range from "end of world" to "obviously just," and maybe it
would matter which one was right, if Australia produced anything worth
consuming now that John Clarke is gone.  One Hackernews links to a Twitter
thread containing a hypothetical implementation of the bad law in which
JIRA foils the spies.

JIRA is an antipattern
December 09, 2018

Australia fires the first volley in its campaign to discredit JIRA, which
was yesterday determined to be the primary counterintelligence force
stopping its spies from spying.  Hackernews breaks out into factional
disputes, depending on which denomination of the Agile religion the poster
adheres.  An argument breaks out about who is more important to a business:
the programmers, or the customers?  Several dozen Hackernews perform the
ancient rite of webforum discussion:  one, trying to explain a concept,
outlines a hypothetical scenario; the rest, completely ignoring any point
anyone is trying to make, bikeshed the scenario by laser-focusing on one
tiny irrelevant aspect (in which they happen to be expert).  No technology
is discussed.

Companies use smartphone locations to help advertisers and even hedge funds
December 10, 2018

A journalist gets the scoop:  when a company measures every single element
of your personal life, it's because they would like to sell that
information for money.  Hackernews is less concerned about outmoded
flyover-state concepts like "privacy" or "dignity" and is instead super
concerned with reverse engineering the location service that Google ships
on their phones.  A few Hackernews make a desultory attempt to theorize a
world in which people weren't immediately preyed upon the moment they touch
a computer, but nobody can really muster up much energy for trash-talking
Google's business model.

Firefox 64 Released
December 11, 2018

Mozilla shoves another featureless release of their web browser out the
door.  The only user-detectable change in this release was made by someone
who does not work for Mozilla and was paid for by Google.  Like all stories
about browser releases, this one is five hundred comments from people who
are angry about some weird-ass extension they started using in 2003, people
angrily replying that some other weird-ass extension is better, and people
angrily declaring you don't need an extension because that database has
been built into the address bar for ten years now.  Mozilla still hasn't
mastered HTML 4[0], but now that the bug report is old enough to drink,
they're at least starting to invent excuses for not fixing it.

Robinhood launches 3% checking account

Some dipshits would like to act like a bank without doing any of the things
that banks are required to do.  The dipshits (motto: "Uber for financial

potential customers about it, which is a new record for Silicon Valley
efficiency.  Hackernews, trying to understand, reinvents banking from first
principles, even going so far as to identify places where a given society
may be required to implement restrictions on financial markets.  After
that, it's just a matter of every single Hackernews naming every single

Sandspiel – A falling sand game built in Rust and WebGL

debates where the dark matter might be hiding in Kubernetes.  Theories
abound, impromptu abbreviations are created to describe various flavors of
complexity, and hundreds of comments appear whining that other developers
never document anything well enough.  Hackernews, of course, is fastidious
in their documentation practices, unless they get distracted or bored.

the article itself receives a frenzy of vote increases, the content is
technical, so Hackernews observes the traditional ten-to-one vote to
comment ratio.  Most of the comments thirst for embedded systems
development in Rust, which is of course a perfect fit for a language so
elegant and lightweight that it must be implemented in six million lines of
C++ grafted onto a multi-gigabyte compiler toolchain.

DuckDuckGo will use Apple Maps

Some webshits change teams, and the Hackernews partisans gird their loins

My dog was killed on a walk with a walker ordered through Wag
January 17, 2019

A Facebook reports that a stranger got a pet killed.  Hackernews decides
that a software company can make process changes to keep dogs from dying.
Some Hackernews suggest maybe checking ahead of time to see if you're
handing your dog to someone with a track record of not killing dogs, but
this idea is dismissed as wasteful luddite nonsense.  Hackernews digs up
similar stories of phone app vendors not giving a shit about their
customers or employees, and much outrage is expressed.  Despite the fact
that "not giving a shit about customers or employees" is the founding
principle of the gig economy, Hackernews thinks these problems can all be
solved with fatter databases.

Google proposes changes to Chromium which would disable uBlock Origin

Google continues the war against its own users.  After declaring an intent
to further cripple extension functionality, Google is met with moderate
pushback from people who write or use browser extensions.  They are
reassured that the functionality they demand is not disappearing entirely;
merely being replaced with completely inapplicable other functionality,
which should serve everyone's needs when combined with vague promises about
future plans.  In the basement of the Mountain View campus, the Google
Analytics team soberly takes notes on which internet citizens should be
executed for sedition.  Hackernews tries to keep off the List, but a few

How to Be Successful

"Hacker" "News'" absentee step-brother shits out a blog post containing
instructions for being rich.  Most of the advice boils down to being
arrogant, rich, or well-connected, which basically exhausts Sam Altman's

business at the height of an economic bubble, but that's the only actual
advice that might apply to anyone reading this drivel.  Hackernews
experiments with definitions of success that don't require being a wealthy
sycophantic jackass, and the author arrives to peddle more off-target

Apple blocks Google from running its internal iOS apps

war against their users.  It turns out that both Google and Facebook have
'internal' iPhone applications, which leads to the obvious question: why
the fuck would they do that?  Nobody knows, and Hackernews isn't interested
in finding out.  The only questions Hackernews wants to answer are "how
dare Google and Facebook defy Apple's Holy Writ," and "how dare Apple treat
Google and Facebook like they were some random third-party strangers."
These answers, as well, are moot; Apple has relented and allowed the other
two back into the church.

hellbox.  The picture it paints is the saddest thing I have ever seen on
the internet.  Hackernews gets sucked into an inquest into the ontological
implications of demanding an audience of strangers for every moment of your
working day.  Other Hackernews complain that some minute detail was elided.

Sunlight through glass does not provide Vitamin D
February 25, 2019

An idiot wants to know how glass works, and turns to the world's leading
authority on human physiology: the New York Times.  Hackernews thinks you
should have windows anyway, and feels the need to justify this opinion.
Half of the comments are from people afraid of sunlight.  The other half
are arguments about which pills you can eat to make up for being a cave
troll.  Since the topic is not technology, but (pseudo)medicine, Hackernews
has a shitload to say -- vote-to-comment ratio hovers right around 2:1.
Almost all of it is wrong, but that's fine since all of it is irrelevant to
functioning human adults.

Redis Turns 10 – How it started with a single post on Hacker News
February 26, 2019

Hackernews celebrates the decennial anniversary of a database so bad that
almost all of its use is as a message queue.  Hackernews explores the idea
of a program being completed, instead of an endless churn of Github issues
and conference talks with stick figure illustrations.  Hackernews lines up
to relate stories about how wonderful the software is, then the next line
is for them to reminisce about the first time their server got hacked
because they were running it.

UC terminates subscriptions with Elsevier in push for open access

Lyft Files S-1

protracted argument regarding whether Lyft is giving too much money to
Amazon Web Services, not enough money, or exactly the right amount of
money.  Another group of Hackernews is impressed that executives at the
company sometimes work for the company; while Hackernews assumes this is to
engender a better understanding of the lives of drones, it's more likely
they were just supplementing their Uber income.  The rest of the comments
are trying to work out how much money everyone has.

abused that it merely controls two and a half of the three branches of the
United States Government.  These fears are met with similar concerns for

Some bureaucrats set fire to tax money, and the result is a pointless
microcustomization of an existing font.  Hackernews argues about whether
web fonts are a terrible burden or a fundamental human right, but that's
just a warmup for the main event:  the United States Forestry Service has a
website that doesn't work without javascript.  Is this a concentrated
attack on people with slow computers, or a sign of the times?  Explanation
not considered:  rich, high-bandwidth webshits who suck at their jobs.

Congress Is About to Ban the US Government from Offering Free Online Tax Filing
April 09, 2019

The United States Congress continues the war against its own users.  In
this salvo, webshit middlemen have paid various politicians to ensure their
rent-seeking business models will survive.  Hackernews wrings its hands at
the impossibility of avoiding the webshit middlemen, and wonder aloud if
there might be some method of intervening in a market determined to fuck
the customer.  If only there were someone who could represent American
citizens when coming up with these rules!

Unveiling the first-ever image of a black hole [video]
April 10, 2019

A pack of Euros gathers together to practice their English.  Hackernews
trades YouTube links to fill in the vocabulary they're missing.  One
Hackernews contributes an essay claiming that the lack of global peace
could be remediated via marketing.  Other Hackernews try, based entirely on
the contents of one TEDx talk, to figure out how this cutting-edge
multinational radioimaging project works.

Julian Assange arrested in London
April 11, 2019

A migrant enlists the help of the Metropolitan Police Service to move

extrapolate next steps, but instead get lost inside the clouds of their own
assumptions.  Everyone has a good time anyway; nobody at "Hacker" "News"
cares what's actually happening anywhere near as much as the opportunity to
incorrect one another on police procedure, international law, espionage,

Katie Bouman, the computer scientist behind the first black hole image
April 11, 2019

Hackernews declares an emergency recess from the Wikileaks bickering, as
important news is brought to light:  one of the scientists who worked on
the black-hole imaging research is not only female but had the audacity to
lead a project.  This horrific breach of "culture fit" rallies Hackernews
around the world to question this so-called scientist's credentials,
approach, methods, etiquette, personal history, social media output, and
even (just in case) whether or not this so-called scientist actually did
anything Hackernews can identify as work, such as copying text files to
GitHub or blogging about PowerPoint alternatives.  None of the Hackernews
can quite follow the math well enough to decide, so they declare the black
hole picture to be cooties-contaminated and try to put this whole
terrifying incident behind them.

Great developers are raised, not hired
April 12, 2019

A motivational speaker suggests that more programmers might be successful
if anyone bothered to show them what the fuck was going on.  Hackernews
tries to reconcile this possibility with their personal experience of never
getting promoted and only getting raises by finding new strangers to snow.
Nobody can seem to figure out what benefit there is in training younger
programmers, since the natural result of such mentorship is that little
shit is going to go get fuck-you money instead of working for Hackernews.
Downthread, Hackernews invents the labor union apprenticeship program from
first principles.  One Hackernews insists that anyone who fails to devote
themselves utterly to whoever hires them is not a 'real engineer.'

South Korea now recycles 95% of its food waste

Korea alters the disposition of specific kinds of trash, moving it from

start ranting about using machine learning to enable robots to look at
garbage.  Other Hackernews recite numbers at each other in lieu of

Single-dose propranolol tied to ‘selective erasure’ of anxiety disorders
April 14, 2019

Some academics think they can use chemicals to take the edge off a
traumatic memory.  Hackernews, as usual, spends the afternoon in a lively
game of armchair psychiatric theorizing.  Some Hackernews approach it by
relating all the myriad self-medication experiments they've undertaken.
Others prefer to spend their time imagining a bleak future of oppressive
drugged militias.  One Hackernews, an advanced player, declares that the
mere idea of removing a specific type of anxiety is itself anxiety-
inducing.  Everyone plays the game differently, but they're all careful not
to speak aloud the real reason this story was voted so highly: the promise
of a future where Thursday's "culture fit incident" doesn't keep Hackernews
awake at night, mourning that one GitHub account's obviously superior
commit history.

Mozilla WebThings

May 17, 2019

CNN notices a seventy-three-year-old grocery chain.  The article is too
long, so Hackernews independently reports every single fact contained
therein as a timesaving measure.  The European division of Hackernews
wanders into a corner to argue about which grocery store is best.  American
Hackernews note that they save money when they shop at stores that have
lower prices.

Virtual DOM is pure overhead (2018)
May 18, 2019

Some webshits have opinions about javascript.  Specifically, the opinions
are about which overengineered abstraction javascript victims should swear
fealty to.  Since the meat of the article is pointless microbenchmarks
being used to justify sweeping generalizations regarding implementation
details, Hackernews goes absolutely nuts.  Three hundred comments appear,
each one a graduate-level thesis explaining precisely the best way to
reimplement basic web browser functionality using nothing but a programming
language, several hundred megabytes of libraries, a virtual machine, a
transpiler, and a web browser.  Along the way, the Semantic Web people
start throwing bombs, and a million unread thinkpieces die in the blast.

Playdate – A New Handheld Gaming System
May 22, 2019

Some Internets would like to sell you a handheld video game system with all
the expense and inconvenience of a Nintento 2DS but without the color
screens or the games you want to play.  Hackernews enjoys bad video games
and kitschy electronics, so plenty of both are recited from memory, linked
to, and discussed.  Since the product in the article is currently
vaporware, Hackernews decides to argue about whether the crank on the
device is a gimmick or a useful input device.

GitHub Sponsors
May 23, 2019

Microsoft regards Patreon as a threat to GitHub's lock-in business model,
and does something about it.  Hackernews is doubtful of the concept of
accepting money for work performed, and suggests instead selling ad space
in README files.  Despite the fact that people have been able to distribute
money in myriad ways for centuries, Hackernews believes that GitHub getting
involved is a fundamental revolution.  A fight breaks out regarding whether
seeding the virtual hat proffered to the software buskers' audience will
encourage donations or convince the marks to find needier performers.
Later, some Hackernews notice that this is more lock-in fodder, and some
Microsofts arrive to defend their realm.

Apple removes game after Chinese company cloned, trademarked, requested takedown

A Reddit finds out nobody cares.  Hackernews suspects that the Reddits are
misrepresenting Papa Apple's extremely infallible process, and start
digging around for games they don't play in languages they don't speak in
order to defend Apple's virtue.  Some Hackernews want to spend time
competing to see who knows the most about registering trademarks in a
nation known for ignoring any and all intellectual property laws.  Other

First American Financial Corp. Leaked Hundreds of Millions of Insurance Records

An insurance firm spills their actuarial tables.  Hackernews lists all the
ways that they are smarter than every large organization that exists.  A
debate is held regarding whether regular counting is okay or long strings
of text should be used to index data instead.  Many Hackernews feel that
these organizations should be held responsible for careless handling of
other people's information, as long as the people in those organizations
who are actually held responsible will be at a comfortable distance from
the programmers tasked with implementing the data management.

Why I'm still using jQuery

javascript at all anywhere" to "I am angry that my operating system still
contains non-javascript software."  Because the article has no actual

interpret abstraction libraries to whether people who do not use specific

Google to restrict modern ad blocking Chrome extensions to enterprise users

concerned that there is literally only one web browser on earth and it is
actively hostile to performing the functions the user would like it to

Mozilla exists at Google's convenience and thus Mozilla is just an

shoes, spending eighty-five percent of their income on studio lofts,
drinking Soylent products in their open-plan offices eighteen hours per

Microsoft's Linux Kernel
June 28, 2019

Microsoft complies with the licensing requirements of the software it
distributes.  It has no choice, because there is no company to buy,
dismantle, and integrate into Windows 10 Plus!  Pack for Makers.  Some
Hackernews are excited to be able to run useful software without
sacrificing the opportunity to pump "telemetry" data to a corporation.
Other Hackernews think that this solution is too simple and should be
replaced with a larger house of cards comprised of less well-integrated
software choices.  The rest of the comments are Hackernews incorrecting one
another about which Microsoft products are better than the Unix
alternatives that existed before any of the commenters learned to read.

SKS Keyserver Network Under Attack
June 29, 2019

A security imagineer is angry that someone broke some shitty software.  The
flaws have been identified and other solutions are available.  The
imagineer thinks the shitty software is important enough that people should
stop being mean to it, but not important enough to fix any of the well-
documented, vine-ripened problems built into the core concepts.  The
Hackernews Beauty Pageant Gold Medalist, who has not produced anything of
use since the Bush administration, flits throughout the comment thread to
tell people that they shouldn't use the most widely-used email encryption
practices on the planet, but instead some webshit chat thing or a phone app
from a person with an entertaining nickname.  This advice is of course
useless to most of the planet, but a gold medal is a gold medal, so
Hackernews sullenly votes any dissenting opinion into the dirt.  Almost all
of the discourse focuses on GPG, which is not the problem here, and ignores
the actual software with the actual failure.

The German Tank Problem
June 30, 2019

Choose Boring Technology
July 01, 2019

A webshit spends way too much time drawing pictures that are intended to
tangentially support the core thesis, which is that programmers should use
software they are familiar with.  Hackernews excitedly reports that such
practices lead to software that works.  Some Hackernews angrily insist that
this is a difficult approach for people who do not know anything, and the
resulting discussion invents the concept of apprenticeship from first
principles.  In another thread, Hackernews discusses the idea that "code is
a liability," which is dangerously close to the truth:  coders are the
liability.

Cloudflare Network Performance Issues
July 02, 2019

Having settled down from last week's public pillorying of Verizon, after
Verizon torpedoed other people's networks by activating faulty software,
Cloudflare torpedoes other people's websites by activating faulty software.
Hackernews is mad that Cloudflare's status page, like all other webshit
status pages, is so inaccurate as to be entirely useless.  Other Hackernews

How to write idempotent Bash scripts
July 07, 2019

A webshit has things to say about writing shell scripts whose components
return fewer errors.  Hackernews, of course, has even more things to say,
and goes into detail about all of the horrific practices they inflict on
innocent computers.  Most of them immediately turn to installing dozens or
hundreds of megabytes of Python or Ruby on every computer they touch,
because it's easier to trust some shit you pip installed than it is to
understand the ramifications of the garbage you're flailing into the
keyboard.  There is, in the world of Hackernews, no middle ground between
"running a shell script" and "directing system state with a domain-specific
language selected entirely on how many stars its repo has on GitHub."
Later, some Hackernews try to figure out exactly what "idempotent" actually
means.

Vulnerability in the Mac Zoom client allows malicious websites to enable camera

A chat program emulates FaceTime's "don't bother asking the receiver"

that consent is optional.  Hackernews can't decide if the company should

hosts a reception in the chat program while Hackernews struggles to
identify the precise layer of abstraction that contains the failure.
Later, when normal people find out about this bullshit, the chat company
reverses course.

The PGP Problem

The Hackernews Beauty Pageant Gold Medalist is mad about PGP.  Hundreds of
words are recycled about all the problems.  As usual, the only solution
offered to replace email (a protocol in use by approximately the entire
internet) are a bunch of centralized all-or-nothing silos that interoperate
barely or not at all.  No new information appears in this particular
rehashing of the PGP Temper Tantrum, so Hackernews has a well-practiced
collection of canned responses and anecdotes agreeing with and reinforcing
the tantrum.  A few Hackernews bring up the profound level of shittiness of
Signal as a replacement for email, but the subject is quickly changed to
avoid angering the resident security hucksters.  None of the people
recommending Signal protocol products have any Signal protocol contact
information in their profiles.  All of them have email addresses.  One of
them has a PGP key.

MITM on HTTPS traffic in Kazakhstan
July 18, 2019

A web browser is asked to declare cyberwarfare on a sovereign nation.
Rather than refusing the task, the developers of the web browser slowly
begin to realize the consequences of decades of aggressively insisting on
being the keymasters of Internet trust:  they are now expected to actively
oppose an organization which, instead of a failed phone OS and some
bookmark syncing software, possesses things such as a literal army.
Hackernews thinks the sovereign nation will lose the conflict, because
nobody is more powerful than the Certificate Authority Browser Forum.  One
Hackernews suggests that maybe x.509 certificates are possibly not going to
directly solve every single information security problem on Earth, but is
quickly renditioned to an unnamed Eastern European nation for rest and

8chan goes dark after hardware provider discontinues service

classed as a public service and regulated as national infrastructure.  The
fact that the cartoon pornography archive has become for mass-murder

shoes does not, in Hackernews' mind, factor into this discussion.  One

Steam Windows Client Local Privilege Escalation 0day
August 07, 2019

A digital trading-card vendor sucks at computer programming and is not
interested in the consequences.  Hackernews slowly realizes that all
corporate security reporting facilities are public-relations damage control
operations.  Many similar stories are told, and at the end of all of them
nothing happens.  A massive argument breaks out about whether computer
games are worth money.  Another breaks out over whether privilege
separation is even a good idea to begin with, since it makes everything
such a pain in the ass.

The Lonely Work of Moderating Hacker News
August 08, 2019

An Internet examines the groundskeepers of the "Hacker" "News" estate.  To
the surprise of nobody, it turns out to be wealthy old people.  The author
demonstrates exceptionally good taste in selection of representation for
the opposition.  Hackernews revels in spotlight adjacency, but rankles at
all attempts to extract a representative sample of comments.  Comments
which are selected based on being highest-voted are decreed not to be
representative.  Multi-hundred comment threads are declared irrelevant to
understanding Hackernews' internal dialog.  No technology is discussed.

Alan Kay's answer to ‘what are some forgotten books programmers should read?’
August 09, 2019

A computer nerd compiles a track list for a literary mixtape, then throws
it onto a garbage scow.  Hackernews toys with amusing recreational ideas
like "reading books" or "learning to use software" but most of the comments
are suggestions for additional books to not read or links to similar
mixtapes from nerds each individual commenter prefers to listen to.  One
Hackernews is worried that failure to obsessively focus on one topic might

is hard, so it's best to just keep learning the same thing forever.

human beings or because philately is out of vogue.  The comment threads
common to all discussions about techno are present:  people pretending to
be interested in making more of it, people pretending to be interested in
other people's opinions of it, and clenched-teeth debates about which
particular beeps and whistles are appropriate to which arbitrary sub-sub-
subgenre titles.  On a related note:  the terms "techno" and "electronic
music" are interchangeable; I am not accepting feedback on this topic at

16M Americans will vote on hackable paperless machines

A journalist reminds us that computers are terrible, even when we depend on
them.  The article is largely obscured by a pointless "read more" link,
which when clicked just reveals more of the text that was already loaded,
and which I am feverishly porting to this website as fast as possible.
Hackernews spends some time wallowing in political-party conspiracy
theories, then divides into two separate camps.  One camp wants to argue
about whether computers can ever be made less terrible, and all of the
plans for doing so involve hiring Hackernews to do everything correctly.
The other camp wants to argue about how all the other countries do
everything better than America does, which is why the residents of those
countries closely follow American politics, while Americans regard those
countries as cheap sources of labor, if we regard those countries at all.

account for the horrible behavior we've all had to put up with since the
author received some kind of face transplant, came back to Walford with
basically no notice, and started ruining Sonia and Stacey's lives for no
good reason at all.  The author spent so much time being so controlling of
Stacey and pressuring her into marrying, and then of course when confronted
with a problem not solvable by punching someone, the divorce papers come
back out.  Such a coward.  I'm not saying Stacey is a saint (and of course
Sonia had her own problems) but nobody deserves this.  Hackernews
completely ignores all of these important issues and just talks about the
right way to type computer programs.  Hackernews is such a Poppy.

A webshit has opinions about webshit.  Hackernews organizes themselves into
two groups:  those who interact with the web on a computer, all of whom
would like some manner of syndication, and those who interact with the web
on a mobile phone, all of whom think this functionality belongs in whatever
messaging application their friends use.  The Children of 3GPP are
eventually victorious, as the Vested Elders of the Hinge and Switch tear
each other apart arguing over whether web browsers should be responsible
for browsing syndication feeds.  After all, that's not the job of a web
browser -- the web browser is there to render HTML, display pictures, play
sounds and videos, render 3D graphics, provide a platform for interactive
video games, support your virtual reality headset, provide enough operating
system primitives to support an entire JITted language capable of being
used to write email clients, realtime GIS packages, CAD/CAM operations, and
manage radio communications with hardware peripherals.  Asking it to also
render one XML document is, according to Hackernews, unreasonable.

Google takes potshots at a competitor's product.  Presumably Google's

3D Ken Burns Effect from a Single Image

An academic creates a method for automatically making pictures less
interesting.  The author then shows up in the comments to argue with
Hackernews about how many of them clicked on the video.  Then, Hackernews
nitpicks the terminology, resulting in a collaborative catalogue of all the
various ways that filmmakers can make pictures less interesting to look at.

The boring technology behind a one-person Internet company
September 16, 2019

A webshit goes on at length about the same tools all other webshits use.
Hackernews is relieved to see that any website exists which was not created
via résumé-driven development methodologies, so they recount the stories of
their own failed résumé-driven development projects.  Other Hackernews,
horrified at the prospect of a programmer understanding how the entire
program works, insist that actual full-stack development is the demesne of
monks (after decades of study) or geniuses (after reading three medium.com
articles like this one).  Those of you who are reading this week's article
to hear about the copyright cult ousting the pedo apologist will be
disheartened to learn that this story received hundreds more votes than
that one.

Gitlab More Than Doubles Valuation to $2.75B Ahead of Planned 2020 IPO

several Gitlabs arrive in the comments to bask in the adulation and/or make
excuses for the shortcomings.  A third of the comments are in threads
complaining about other people not using the product enough.  Some of the

cynical viral marketing piece from the jewelry manufacturer, a notoriously
slow-selling and impoverished business known for its inability to move
product.  Hackernews bickers over whether failure to acquire this specific
jewelry constitutes rank negligence, then bickers over which brand of
jewelry is the most responsible purchase.  Poor people are, of course,

Hackernews is hesitant to criticize the software decisions of a company

In Defense of Richard Stallman

Some webshit is angry about an elderly moron being held accountable.  The
argument goes that we should tolerate decades of pedo apologism, creepy
behavior, and general asshattery because the author agrees with some legal
opinions of the creep in question.  It is this moron's right, so the
argument goes, to act and think like a shithead, because otherwise we might
not have got a specific legal document, which a subset of computer nerds
finds valuable.  Hackernews takes this weak-ass argument and with it builds
a springboard from which to dive into an open cesspit, finally freed of the
requirement that they act like human beings even for a moment.  None of the
comments presented in this thread are new, and none of them are

Hong Kong protest safety app banned from iOS store

Attorney General will ask Zuckerberg to halt plans for end-to-end encryption

networks, computers, or telephony, attempt to concern-troll a corporation
with a track record of never being held accountable by any government.  The
bureaucrats seem convinced that being able to talk to someone else without
some cops eavesdropping will somehow hurt children.  Hackernews isn't sure
if this is true.  That is to say, some Hackernews are unconvinced that the
safety of children is the primary concern of the bureaucrats, and other
Hackernews are unconvinced that privacy will necessarily cause harm to
children.  Nobody in the respective governments or the corporation in
question is interested in the opinions of any other party in this
conversation, but Hackernews has a good time trying to reverse-engineer
everyone else's intentions.  Later, Hackernews tries to decide if jerking
it to pictures of naked kids emboldens sickos to move on to actually
interfering with alive kids, or if there's just a basic percentage of
child-fucking that we just have to accept is going to happen in human
society.

Pricing niche products

experts on economics and associated psychological treatises, weigh in on
the correct methods for charging money to do things.  When considering the
method of determining optimum price for a consumer product relative to the
market for that product, nobody remembers to suggest raising venture
capital to overpay for the entire production run, then writing a cellphone
program to allow people to rent the products while you file for an IPO and
hope you can pay back your investors with the resulting stock sale.
Sadly, this omission may be due to the entirety of Hackernews yelling at
each other about which keyboard is best, whether any keyboards are even
good, and what kind of an idiot even needs a keyboard, given that your
Macbook Pro already came with one.

Stack Overflow Inc. Fiasco: Timeline
October 06, 2019

An Internet who is obsessed with a web forum types eighteen hundred words
about the web forum operators continuing the war against their own users.
The web forum in question is extremely important to Hackernews, since it
serves as a substitute for an actual education.  It's not possible to tell
if Hackernews is mad that people have opinions about how they are treated
on the internet or if Hackernews is mad that someone is threatening the
Codex Decuplus, from which all nodeledge stems.  The argument is determined
to be a perfect platform from which to announce an utter disinterest in
"politics," which is a word that Hackernews understands to mean "any issue
that does not directly affect a meaningful percentage of the FAANG
companies' boards of directors."  The reasoning is that if those boards are
unaffected, Hackernews is unlikely to be directly affected now or in the
foreseeable future, so the people who are raising this issue are irrelevant
twerps.  The users of the web forum are urged to ignore this distraction
and get back to cataloging the text that Hackernews will be pasting into VS
Code next week.

Apple Hides Taiwan Flag in Hong Kong
October 07, 2019

Apple continues dauntlessly to stand up for its corporate values:
Accessibility (the Chinese government has access to Apple's product
management), Education (we'll teach you to stand up for yourselves),
Environment (these changes should result in a marked decrease in tear gas
canister expenditure), Inclusion and Diversity (Apple will equitably narc
on dissidents from all walks of life), Privacy (Apple will do its utmost to
assist you in keeping your beliefs to yourself), and Supplier
Responsibility (never has a computer vendor been more responsible to the
nation of its suppliers).  Hackernews is infuriated by the idea that there
may exist an entity with enough power to dictate terms to a tech company,
since only tech companies are possessed of the divine right.  The resulting
freakout calls into question the rule of law, the practice of sovereign
treaty, how powerful a country must be before it's worth taking their
government seriously, who should be in charge of reinventing statehood from
first principles, and which companies are best suited to standing up to
oppressors.  Apple takes no note of this dialogue; its policy remains
steadfast.  Whether an old person falls over or a young person stands up,
Apple will call the cops.

responsible for defending the civil rights that enabled them to become

law reform.  Other Hackernews debate whether software users should be
banned from corporate services immediately upon expressing any opinions, or
whether it's better to wait a bit so we can be sure we only blacklist
people who actually mean the things they say.  The broad consensus is that
people should be allowed to say whatever they want in any venue they happen
to find, unless it might cost a massive corporation any profit at all, in
which case everyone should shut the fuck up.

gotten so unmanageably huge that it just hires morons and ships whatever
garbage software they produce without any quality control.  The answer is
both, of course, but Hackernews gets bored with this question and decides
the real problem is economics.  One Hackernews posts the traditional "this

Don't Call Yourself a Programmer, and Other Career Advice (2011)
October 20, 2019

The Hackernews Beauty Pageant Bronze Medalist, who has not meaningfully
contributed to human society, has advice for people who would like to have
some money but are not yet committed to the idea of contributing to human
society.  Most of the advice involves assuming that your cohort is
competent and able and that you should therefore not assume you are an
imminent disaster.  This assumption is incorrect but taking the advice is
likely to work, since self-sabotage is a pretty safe thing to advise
against.  Hackernews tries to find something in this wall of text they're
allowed to disagree with, and settles on bikeshedding the job
specifications themselves.  Since the author has never held an actual job
in a real company, neither side of the disagreement has any idea what
they're talking about, so no conclusions are reached.

NordVPN confirms it was hacked
October 21, 2019

Some assholes acknowledge that they let you down, but assure you that it
was a long time ago, baby, and that you don't need to worry any more;
they'll never do it again because they love you.  Hackernews sees through
this bullshit and (in between sessions of reinventing the service industry
from scratch) takes down some of the more fragile constructs in the
assholes' web of lies.  This would not have any effect on anything, because
nobody who would pay for the assholes' product reads Hackernews, but in a
surprise twist, one of the assholes in question shows up to personally lose
arguments with people and serve as volunteer intermediary for the two
remaining people at the asshole company who remember what the problem was.

Hackernews are angry that it is insufficiently similar to either Safari or

Firefox password manager, and is met with a pile of excuses.

US Constitution – A Git repo with history of edits
October 23, 2019

An Internet translates the United States Constitution's changes over time
into git.  Thanks to this, we're able to relive the experience of Alexander
Hamilton's historic "Format paragraphs with new lines" crisis, as well as
examine the pivotal .editorconfig file, rumored to have been manually
created by Betsy Ross using her husband John Claypoole's personal copy of
LINED on their family PDP-6.  Hackernews learns a few things about United
States history but mostly just bitches; the most common complaints are that
not enough legal documents are treated as computer programs or that whoever
did this didn't obsess enough about the process.

Twitter to ban political advertising

There's no math involved, so Hackernews posts a thousand comments debating

I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb
October 31, 2019

An Internet discovers a scam on Airbnb, which is presumably a different
scam than Airbnb itself.  It turns out that by entering into a contract in
good faith, getting pushed around by a stranger on the internet, and then
completely failing to hold anyone accountable, it's possible to lose money
without receiving goods or services.  The article goes into lengthy,
pointless detail about the failed attempts to find out what the hell was
going on, and then concludes by embracing some sort of revolting Stockholm
syndrome and declaring fealty to a business who takes a cut of the scam.
Hackernews recounts all the ways Airbnb has shafted them as well.  It's a
shame, decides Hackernews, that there is literally no other choice.  All
you can do is take an Uber to your Airbnb and get counterfeit goods
delivered by Amazon.

Google Buys Fitbit for $2.1B

Google identifies the next product to discontinue.  Hackernews struggles
with definitions of extremely product-relevant concepts, like "democracy."
Along the way we learn that democracy doesn't work as well in America as it
does in Europe, where approximately 20% of countries are still hereditary
monarchies.  When that gets boring, Hackernews engages in a dick-measuring
contest to determine who is the strongest computer programming corporation.
Some Hackernews fret about the data they've spent years uploading to some
stranger's computer suddenly being on a different stranger's computer, but
most of the rest of the comments are bickering about another extremely
relevant topic: lexicography.

Gitlab considers not hiring SREs and Support Engineers in China and Russia
November 03, 2019

An internet company declines to give access to sensitive data to people who
live in countries run by murderous fuckheads.  The resulting discussion is
immediately overrun by people in those countries who are okay with
murderous fuckheads running things.  Hackernews, like most of the
commenters in the linked page, can't seem to understand why countries even
exist as a concept, and is confused by the idea that massive well-armed
highly-organized oligarchies might do bad things despite existing corporate
policy to the contrary.  All of the comments amount to a debate as to
whether the Chinese government is a pack of assholes (it is) and whether
USA #1 (also yes).  For a fleeting moment, Hackernews wonders if a company
shouldn't be allowed to do whatever the hell it wants... but the moment
passes, as sufficient excuses are located.  No technology is discussed.

Former Twitter Employees Charged with Spying for Saudi Arabia

An internet company gives access to sensitive data to people who live in
countries run by murderous fuckheads.  Hackernews regards the resulting
abuses as inevitable, but is mostly just contemptuous of the low-quality
spycraft at play.  The previous debate is resumed and extended to new
players:  is Saudi Arabia run by assholes?  Is America as wonderful as
people claim it is?  Are China and Russia real threats to human freedom?
Should corporations be held criminally liable for failure to implement
rigorous customer data protections?  The answer to all of these questions
is obviously "of course, you moron, why are you even asking this stupid
question," but Hackernews isn't so sure.

Async-await on stable Rust

The Rust Evangelism Strike Force proclaims from on high that the previous
flawless approach to asynchronicity was in fact terrible, and not what
anyone meant to make, but this new version is perfect, and will get even
better Real Soon Now.  Hackernews is concerned because, among many other
problems, it seems to be completely moot unless entire programs are re-
engineered to utterly embrace this incompatible code, but they're assured
that this concern is invalid because other programming languages are actual
curses dragged from hell by Met Kalfou himself.  Inexplicably, the chorus
of praise fails to be unanimous, and a confused Rust Evanglism Strike Force
is forced to hunt individual apostates in squads.

Some webshits advertise their product, which amounts to a wiki that you

people who type in computer programs for a living should not be asked to

computer programmers who were allowed to operate in a vacuum, resulting in
the implosion of the businesses which employed them.  The majority of the
arguments are between people who think that the choices a business has
available are "interrupt the computer programmer every ten minutes forever"
or "never speak to or shine lights at a computer programmer between
assignment of task and completion of product," with as usual no possibility
of compromise.

Calculus Explained with GIFs and Pics (2014)
November 30, 2019

An Internet posts some math.  There's an image macro with Will Ferrell in
it, which I assume makes it different enough from "some rando's high school
notebook" that Hackernews finds it voteworthy.  I'm not sure any of them
are even paying attention any more.  There are even fewer comments than
there were about the last math story, and half of them are a discussion of
how wrong the article is.  The author shows up and asks for tips on making
Chinese people care.

PIA VPN to be acquired by malware company founded by former Israeli spy
December 01, 2019

An Internet warns us that our network security vendor is at risk of being
turned into a profitable business.  The VPN provider named in the article
arrives in the comments and is immediately subject to dozens of lectures
about ethics from Hackernews.  The central thrust of the lectures is the
unacceptability of running a business centered around advertising and user
tracking.  The fact that advertising and user tracking is all of
Hackernews' day jobs is not mentioned.

Sundar will be the CEO of both Google and Alphabet
December 03, 2019

Google takes a few steps towards admitting their byzantine corporate
structure is irrelevant.  Hackernews tries to get to the bottom of What It
All Means, and they focus on the most important facet of that
investigation:  what will Larry Page and Sergey Brin do now?  The obvious
answer, "it doesn't matter," is disregarded.  The rest of the comments are
people trying to convince each other how important Google executives are to
us on a personal level and why we should track and emulate their every
move.

Fight back against Google AMP (2018)
December 04, 2019

A webshit who gets paid to ratfuck Google's search results is angry that
Google is taking over the entire web.  Hackernews is torn:  some are glad
that there is finally a way to quickly display static content, which the
web has never been able to do before, while the others are angry that
Google doesn't seem to give a shit about anything but Google.  The rest of
the comments are reverse-engineering possible ways to get similar page-
loading speeds, but no consensus is reached.  The publishers of N-Gate are
investigating switching the content entirely to AMP in order to mitigate
the miserably plodding pace of page loads on this site.

The Great Cannon has been deployed again
December 06, 2019

AT&T chooses to use the passive voice, because they are cowards.  A more
accurate headline is "The Chinese government attacks websites which support
a free Hong Kong," but a better headline would include some information
regarding the Chinese government being comprised of despicable filth.
Hackernews catalogues technical solutions to societal problems, then
hunkers down to discuss the really important question:  do people deserve
to use the internet?  Lots of whining about web protocols follows, with
nobody pointing out the obvious solution here:  the Chinese government must
be overthrown.  This would also solve several other ongoing problems, save
thousands of innocent lives per year, and provide the opportunity for the
Chinese people to select a less ridiculous national anthem.

December 07, 2019

Notably useless asshole Paul Graham whines about school testing, then

Paul Graham thought Paul Graham was, which was extremely smart to begin

FUSE for macOS is no longer open source
December 10, 2019

An Internet throws a temper tantrum because not enough people are paying
for maintenance of code Google wrote.  Hackernews sympathizes with the
temper tantrum; it's supremely frustrating to Hackernews that you can spend
loads of time writing and maintaining software, then release it freely on
the internet, and people selfishly want the software to work as you claimed
it should.  The software is worthless, but the Internet with the tantrum
holds the signing keys to make it work on Macbooks, and it turns out
Apple's blessings are far more valuable than any measly filesystem code.

Google Brass Set 2023 as Deadline to Beat Amazon, Microsoft in Cloud

Google deprecates another service.  Some Googles arrive in the comments to
declare that there's nothing to see here, but Hackernews is not so sure,
since Google has discontinued or ruined every Google product Hackernews has
ever relied upon.  The most common argument is that Google would never dare
to discontinue a service aimed at businesses; it is only mere customers who
are kicked to the curb.  Presumably these people are still extremely
satisfied with their Google Search Appliances.

programming wisdom.  Later, Hackernews mourns the death of Adobe Flash, and
investigates the sixteen thousand half-assed replacements that have popped
up over the years.

Goodbye, Clean Code
January 11, 2020

A webshit seizes the means of abstraction.  Having just read an article on
the topic of inappropriate rigor in software design, Hackernews sets about
generating an inappropriately rigorous metric for deciding when rigor may
be inappropriate.  In the rest of the discussions, Hackernews debates
whether it's appropriate to spend company money duplicating a colleague's
work because you didn't like the shape of the text.

Deploy your side-projects at scale for basically nothing – Google Cloud Run
January 12, 2020

A webshit enthusiastically emits fifteen hundred words describing Google's
reimplementation of CGI, which works absolutely wonderfully as long as
nobody uses any of your websites.  Hackernews is excited about the
possibilities of CGI++, but concerned because (like all cloud services)
there's no way to cap expenditures and nobody at the hosting company gives
a shit about you or your problems.  The cloud apologists arrive to assure
everyone that neither of these are problems and you should just relax and
move your products into this service ASAP.  It's 2020, after all.

iOS 13 app tracking alert has dramatically cut location data flow to ad industry
January 13, 2020

Apple successfully reroutes the digital oil pipelines to their own
refineries.  Hackernews declares that Tim Cook is the chosen one, foretold
to defend us from their day jobs.  Some light Android astroturfing occurs
in response, but is blown away in the relentless gale of hot air about how
much Apple cares about us on an intimate, familial level.

Patch Critical Cryptographic Vulnerability in Microsoft Windows [pdf]
January 14, 2020

The National Security Agency, for the first time in recorded history,
contributes as an Agency to the Security of the Nation.  Hackernews is
always delighted at the opportunity to be seen in public trying to
understand cryptography, even if the lispy webshit they're using isn't
really up to the task.  Other Hackernews realize, with creeping horror,
that Let's Encrypt did not, in fact, protect them against advanced
persistent threats, despite the repeated whining from peripheral security-
theater hucksters.  When will these assholes learn that the only way to
respond to a hostile government is to overthrow it?  Stay tuned to find
out.

Mozilla lays off 70
January 15, 2020

Mozilla successfully defends its title as only unprofitable major web
browser vendor.  The company remains certain that money will begin to flow
from its new product, which promises to hide all your web traffic from
everyone except Mozilla's primary funding source.  Several unemployed
Hackernews show up in the comments to tell us they are not angry about
being shitcanned with no warning.  Another Hackernews thread focuses on the
fact that high-paid executives are treated better by the company than
people who primarily interact with text editors.  Whether this is some kind
of class warfare or the Invisible Hand high-fiving the important people
comprises the rest of the discussion.  The team responsible for the
continued functionality of the Beacon API[0] are safe forever.

Unofficial Apple Archive
January 16, 2020

Apple's equivalent of SeaOrg catalogues decades of corporate propaganda.
Some Hackernews try to decide if Apple made better shit Back In The Goodle
Days or if they're just stuck in a nostalgia fog.  Other Hackernews
gleefully recount their experiences as minor cogs in a massive machine.
The rest of the comments are links to other fansites and arguments about
which OS X widget theme was correct.

A Sad Day for Rust
January 17, 2020

The Rust Evanglism Strike Force regretfully informs us of the
excommunication of the author of one of the six Rust programs anyone
actually uses.  Veterans of the First Webshit Incursion sagely point out
that this day was inevitable from the moment the author made use of certain
features that are built into the core language but regarded as unclean by
the clergy.  Other Hackernews chime in to point out the necessity of being
extremely polite and receptive to every single message received from anyone
with a Github account.  Within days, development of the condemned code
resumes and the twelve websites which depend on the software do not notice
anything happened.

Volkswagen exec admits full self-driving cars 'may never happen'
January 18, 2020

A German correctly assesses an engineering problem.  Hackernews is
convinced that they know better, because a nontrivial percentage of them
receive paychecks from companies that have incorrectly assessed the
engineering problem, and the rest of them because they personally cannot
correctly assess any engineering problem.  Half of the almost nine hundred
comments are in one thread which consists entirely of arguments between
people who drive Teslas once in a while in fair weather and everyone else
on Earth.

My FOSS Story
January 19, 2020

An Internet struggles to be extremely polite and receptive to every single
message received from anyone with a Github account.  The article contains a
shitload of whining interspersed with, and followed by, admonitions that
this shitty situation is in everybody's best interest.  Hackernews agrees,
and praises the author for arguing with people on the internet.  Some
Hackernews briefly experiment with the idea that Github pull requests are
not the most important webshit technology ever developed, but since all the
software that permits disabling them are not Github, no progress is made.

Immune discovery 'may treat all cancer'
January 20, 2020

The British Broadcasting Service weasel-words a scientific discovery into
clickbait.  Hackernews, in between seeing the headline and clicking on the
link, sprouts several medical research doctorates and weighs in with sober
analysis and whatever medical facts they remember reading recently.  Later,
Hackernews lists every malady that should be cured.  One Hackernews thinks
maybe scientific research would work better if it somehow involved pull
requests from Hackernews.  Even Hackernews thinks this is a terrible idea,
but is insufficiently scornful to the originating idiot.

Every Google result now looks like an ad
January 21, 2020

An advertising company blurs the line between the dumb shit you searched
for and the extremely important and well-targeted information you need.
Hackernews doesn't like it, which leads to the same debate Hackernews
always has when Google iteratively befucks its search product:  "use this
other search engine!"  "but that is not Google" "no, but you can make it
redirect to Google."  This is followed, in accordance with Hackernews
tradition, by a litany of complaints about other things Google is doing to
fuck the internet up for everybody; as it turns out, literally everything
Google does is by now aimed at fucking the internet up.
